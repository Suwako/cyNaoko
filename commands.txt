    The languages aa and bb must be specified as an ISO two letter language code.

--- Synchtube Users Only ---
These commands are usable by both mods and non-mods in the Synchtube chat, but not in IRC.

    Adds the video found at the link to the playlist. The video is added to the sql database as if it were added through Synchtube.
    Only mods can add videos when the playlist is locked.

addrandom X
    Adds X random videos to the list, where X defaults to five. The maximum value of X for non-mods is five. Non-mods can only use this command when there are ten or less videos in the playlist.
    This command is throttled so that it can only be called by any user once every five seconds.
    Less restrictions affect mods.

delete [-n X]
    Deletes the last X videos added by the user who calls this command up to a maximum of ten. This will not delete the currently playing video.

    More options are available to mods.

* lastban
* lastbans
    Displays the last ban for the name of the user who calls this command, including the time of the ban, the reason, and the name of the mod who initiated the ban.
    More options are available to mods. Lastbans will only provide a single ban for non-mods, and will also default to one for mods.

    More options are available to mods.

--- Synchtube Mods Only ---
These commands are only available to Synchtube mods in Synchtube chat. Some commands are available to hybrid mods with specific permissions.

special parameters for the kick command.

--- Naoko Administrator Only ---
These functions are only available to the administrator of Naoko through telnet.

* clearRoom(bool kickSelf=False)
    Kicks everyone in the room. No exceptions except Naoko herself, unless kickSelf is True.
    This function is a last resort for recovering access to rooms in unusual circumstances such as hanging connections.
    Invoking this with kickSelf set to True will reinitialize the room object, which will fix any errors related to the
    IP-based connection limit.

command(string message)
    Executes the command in the given message as if it were requested in chat by Naoko herself.
    Subject to all restrictions Naoko has based on her rank, including commandLock.
    The message does not need to be prefixed by $.

importFile(string filename, string name=None)
    Opens <filename>.lst, which is a text file containing a list of urls to vidoes (such as are accepted by $add), one per line.
    Adds every video after verifying it as if it were added by a user with the provided name. If no name is provided they will not be stored in the database.
    This function can take a long time due to spacing out the adds to avoid spamming the Youtube API, and should be used sparingly.
